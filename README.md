You somehow found @joekitch 's github

Any and all of my personal projects or experiments will wash up here (mostly car things) 🚗

One day i'll think pythonically 🐍, but i'm also doing way more work with embedded and CANbus now

Check the projects tab for things i'm working on, and plan to work on later

hit me up at joekitch@gmail.com or @corvolt on instagram
